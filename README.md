# AJDStudios React Template

This is a template repository for a React project. It provides a basic setup and configuration for building React applications with a focus on code quality, linting, formatting, testing, code coverage, and performance auditing.

## Features

- **Linting**: The project includes ESLint for static code analysis and enforcing code quality standards.
- **Formatting**: Prettier is integrated to ensure consistent code formatting across the project.
- **Continuous Integration**: The repository is set up with GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI workflow includes installing dependencies, running linters, running tests, and generating code coverage reports.
- **Testing**: The project uses Jest as the testing framework for unit testing components.
- **Snapshot Testing**: Snapshot testing is implemented to capture and compare component snapshots for visual regression testing.
- **Code Coverage**: Code coverage reports are generated and included in the CI workflow. You can view the coverage reports after running the tests.
- **Build**: The project is set up to build the React application using `react-scripts build`.
- **Development Server**: Use `react-scripts start` to run the development server for local development.
- **Performance Auditing**: Lighthouse is integrated for performance auditing. It measures key performance metrics, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the application.
- **Security Considerations**: The project includes a basic Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration to enhance security. Additional security measures, such as input validation, can be implemented based on project requirements.


## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-template.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run linting and formatting checks: `npm run lint` and `npm run format --check`
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Run tests: `npm test`
6. Generate code coverage report: `npm run coverage`
7. Audit performance with Lighthouse: npm run lighthouse
8. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Folder Structure

The project structure is set up as follows:

- `public/`: Contains the public assets and HTML template.
- `src/`: Contains the application source code.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `styles/`: Contains CSS or SCSS stylesheets.
  - `App.js`: The main component of the application.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the application.
  - `setupTests.js`: Configuration file for setting up the testing environment.

## Testing

The project includes Jest as the testing framework for unit testing components. To run the tests, use the following command:

- `npm test`

Snapshot testing is also implemented to capture and compare component snapshots for visual regression testing.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage reports are generated as part of the CI workflow. After running the tests, you can generate a code coverage report locally using the following command:

- `npm run coverage`

The coverage report will be generated in the `coverage/` directory.

 ## Performance Auditing

The project includes Lighthouse for auditing the performance of the application. To run the performance audit, use the following command:

 - 'npm run lighthouse'

Lighthouse measures key performance metrics, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the application. The audit report will be generated in the terminal and can provide insights into areas for performance optimization.

## Security Considerations

The project includes a basic Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration to enhance security. The default CSP configuration restricts the sources from which the application can load resources like scripts, stylesheets, images, and fonts. This helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other malicious activities.

Additional security measures to consider based on your project needs that are currently not implemented.
  - input validation: Input validation helps prevent common security vulnerabilities, including XSS and SQL injection attacks. Use input validation techniques specific to your chosen programming language or framework.
  - Authentication and Authorization: If your application requires user authentication, ensure that proper authentication mechanisms are implemented, such as password hashing, session management, and secure storage of user credentials. Additionally, implement authorization controls to restrict access to sensitive resources and functionality based on user roles and permissions.
  - Secure Communication: Ensure that sensitive data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using secure protocols like HTTPS. Configure your web server to enforce HTTPS and obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted certificate authority.
  - Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Use generic error messages instead of providing detailed information that could be exploited by attackers.
  - Secure Dependencies: Regularly update and patch the dependencies used in your application to mitigate any known security vulnerabilities. Keep track of security advisories and apply relevant updates promptly. Note the nth-check vulnerabilty in the package is a risk locally, but not for the production environment - this is a common Create-react-app vulnerability flag. running the command 'npm audit --production' should return 0 vulnerabilities, but for peace of mind you can consider updating nth check and going through the necessary extra updates from there. 
  - Security Testing: Perform security testing on your application, such as penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and address any security weaknesses. Consider using automated security testing tools or engaging third-party security experts to conduct comprehensive security assessments.
  - Security Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust logging mechanisms to capture security-related events and monitor them for any suspicious activity. Regularly review logs to detect potential security incidents and respond accordingly. 

It's important to continuously evaluate and update security measures as the project evolves and new security threats emerge.
